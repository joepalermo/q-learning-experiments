# simple-q-learning

This project is an implementation of Q-learning with a simple 'grid-world' environment. An agent is embedded in a grid, and through Q-learning it learns to find its way to a goal located on the other side of the grid. A PyGame animation is included to generate before-learning and after-learning comparisons of the agent's behaviour.

Run q_learning.py to test it. Note that the value function learned can either be tabula or a neural net depending on setup in q_learning.py.
